#Uart-CI

This project is a basic test of Github actions working with [verilator](https://www.veripool.org/wiki/verilator) to build a simple verilog uart transmitter module and automatically runs the tests defined in basicUartTest.cpp

The long term goal is to build a feature complete uart module with a wishbone interface and a full verilator-based testing suite and potentially other verification techniques.
